This module provides source code for aSub
records that support collecting history waveforms
for specified ai PV's, along with some simple
signal analysis of waveforms to provide, MIN,
MAX, AVG, RMS, and StdDev values.

(I,Q) to polar (R,T) conversion is also supported.

Release R0.5.0, Jan 2013.
Slope and Offset added

Release R1.9.0, Oct 2013
X-AXIS waveform added

TODO: Consider merging in ANL's waveProc module
to add FFT spectrum analysis and additional 
waveform signal statistics.
