This module provides source code for aSub
records that support collecting history waveforms
for specified ai PV's, along with some simple
signal analysis of waveforms to provide, MIN,
MAX, AVG, RMS, and StdDev values.

(I,Q) to polar (R,T) conversion is also supported.

TODO: Consider merging in ANL's waveProc module
to add FFT spectrum analysis and additional 
waveform signal statistics.
