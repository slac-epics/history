R2.6.3	2018-08-27 Bruce Hill
	Fixed autosaveFields for history waveforms to not autosave VAL

R2.6.2	2018-01-25 Bruce Hill
	Removed "include base.dbd" line from history.dbd as it
	results in duplicate dbd entries which R3.15.5 disallows.
	No src changes.

R2.6.1	2017-04-19 Bruce Hill
	Filtered out vxWorks cross targets as not yet supported.
	No src changes.

R2.6.0	2017-02-13 Bruce Hill
	Updated for git workflow build support

R2.5.0	2015-04-15 Bruce Hill
	Added configurable publish interval to history buffers.
	Allows a BSA length 2800 item scrolling history buffer to
		replace BSA for scrolling displays while being gateway friendly.

R2.4.0	2015-04-14 Bruce Hill
	Fixed bug that added extra updates to LAST_N history buffers at 0.1Hz SCAN rate

R2.3.0	2015-04-06 Bruce Hill
	Updated to handle nan values gracefully
	Added some BSA specific screens and fixed old iocScreens related display
	Updated RELEASE_SITE for multi-site build support

R2.2.0	2014-10-07 Bruce Hill
	Misc changes incl edm tweaks, comments, adding missing limit fields to autosave, etc.

R2.1.0	2014-02-05 Bruce Hill
	Restored wave_proc_hist db files as fstiming uses them.
	Fixed NELM expansion so fstiming can create 256 element wave_proc_hist waveforms

R2.0.0	2013-11-04 Bruce Hill
	Added a new ai_hist_last_x.substitutions file to serve as a template for quick
		creation of short history buffers of a specified size for statistics.

R1.9.0	2013-11-02 Bruce Hill
	Merged in Garth's updates setting autosave info fields and adding calculation
		of X-AXIS waveforms for each history buffer.
	Also uses single colon substitutions where needed so the number of buffer elements
		can be set via N_SAMPLES macro at load time.

R1.8.0	2013-08-30 Bruce Hill
	Merged in Garth's changes for compatibility w/ LCLS Naming Czars
	Added LCLS stats_aliases.template
	Fixed some PV names in the screens.
	Disabled scroll bars and tweaked window sizes to avoid having scroll bars
		eat into the screen on some windows X11 servers.
	Made aliases for $(PV)_LAST_N_AVG to $(PV)_AVG, etc be automatically
		generated by the standard substitution files.
	Fixed bug in min/max calculations. Bug only shows up if the integer portion
		of the signal is larger than 32 bits.

R1.7.0	2013-08-23 Bruce Hill
	Added smaller versions of the 2x2 history viewer.
	Tweaked screen sizes so entire embedded graph can appear on
		a 1280 width monitor.

R1.6.0	2013-07-31 Bruce Hill
	Changed default number of elements in history arrays from 256 to 300
	Added a 1MIN history period, and changed 10MIN to 6MIN.
	Changes result in history graphs in which the grid markings correspond
		nicely to human usable intervals. Instead of a 10MIN graph divided into 6
		intervals of 100 sec, we get 6 intervals of 1 min each.

R1.5.0	2013-04-20 Bruce Hill
	Add missing include file

R1.4.0	2013-04-10 Bruce Hill
	Made all the bkgds be med-gray so more trace colors would be easy to see.
	Changed some of the viewers to use dark blue for each SIG1 trace
		and made the other signals consistent as well.
	Added notes for new release and add edm....cmd files for the xpp and cxi iocs.
	Changed SIG1 color to purple and background of x-y trace to grey to make the traces easier to view.

R1.3.1	2013-04-08 Alex Wallace
	Changed SIG1, SIG trace color to purple in emb-2, emb-4 and emb-hist-viewer.edl
